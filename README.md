### Welcome to my Profile!


-I am a carpenter turned developer. I have just completed Carleton Univerity's Coding Boot Camp to become a Full Stack Web Developer. 
My goal is to find employment as a developer on a team where I can grow and advance my skills.

My other passion is hockey. I have been a player all my life and now I am a minor hockey coach, Convenor and executive member navigating a return to sport through the pandemic for myself and my kids' teams.
